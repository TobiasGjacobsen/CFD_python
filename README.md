These files are derived for Lorena Barbas 12 steps to Navier-Stokes 

some of the files visulizes the values connected with the gridpoint.
This was used to take a closer look at the compuations between two time steps
and see the exact value of each grid point when the solver runs away. 

The other files are modifications to Lorena barbas channel flow code (step 12)
Different files are inserted with different boundary conditions 

so there are the most basic shapes, a square, a triangle and a circle. 

There are some problems with defining the pressure at the wall condtions.
